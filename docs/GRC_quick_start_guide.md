## What is inside?

The Dev Board has pre-installed applications to demonstrate its abilities to the utmost:
* Gesture – reading, learning and recognizing hand gestures;
* Rhythm – learning and recognizing rhythm patterns;
* Vibro – detecting anomalies in fan work.

The **Warm-Up** mode allows to easily get acquainted with the Dev Board and to start working with it at once.

## Buttons 

* **RESET** for re-starting
* **USER** for control commands

The USER button has three possible uses:
* **Press**: to switch between menu items
* **Press and hold**: to select the menu item displayed on the screen
* **Press, hold and release**: when learning or reading a gesture

## Voice commands

Manage the Dev Board by giving voice commands.

**Example A**: say "**1**" to select and enter the first menu item displayed on a screen.

**Example B**: say "**GO**" to start the gesture learning process and "**STOP**" to finish it.

The list of the command words is given in Appendix A.

## Warm-Up
1. Enter the Warm-Up mode.
2. Select operation “Read: Hi” and show the **Hi** gesture. <img src="media/hi_gesture.png" align="right">
